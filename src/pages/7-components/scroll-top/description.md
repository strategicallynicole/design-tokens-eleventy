We're using `scroll-top` to let the user easily access the top of the page. Per default it is just an anchor that doesn't exist on the page, so the browser scrolls to top. The best place for this is at the bottom of the page, so the user can reach this function with his thumbs instead of reaching for the top of the screen.

We can easily toggle the visibility with some JavaScript and listening for the scroll depth.
