Wraps the whole page in `sdi-wrapper`.

We can now change it's behavior in the setting modifying `$page-max-width`. When NOT set to `none` we can change the maximum width of all elements of the page. It automatically centers the content. The default is `$page-max-width: none` to make header and footer span the whole page. Otherwise it spans the entered width.
